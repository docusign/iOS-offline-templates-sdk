## Native iOS SDK - Localization 

### DocuSign Native iOS SDK supports following languages:

- Chinese Simplified & Traditional (zh-Hans/zh-Hant)
- English (en)
- French (fr)
- German (de)
- Italian (it)
- Japanese (ja)
- Korean (ko)
- Portuguese Brazil / Portugal (pt-BR/pt-PT)
- Russian (ru)
- Spanish (es)

These languages are used automatically depending on the preferred language set in the DocuSign Account for web components (e.g. Online Signing) used in the SDK. For components using native iOS UI (e.g. Offline Signing), SDK will use the app language setting. 

Raise [an issue](https://github.com/docusign/native-ios-sdk/issues) or reach to DocuSign Support Professional if an additional language needs to be supported.
